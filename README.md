Chicken Invader - Python Game
Overview
This project is a Chicken Invader-style game created using Turtle Graphics in Python. Developed as part of a university elective course, this game brings a nostalgic arcade experience with a modern touch. The goal of the game is to defeat waves of chickens descending from above, using your spaceship to shoot at them and avoid their attacks.

Features
Turtle Graphics: The game utilizes the Turtle module for graphics, providing a simple yet effective way to render the game environment and characters.
Classic Gameplay: The core mechanics are inspired by the iconic Chicken Invaders game, where the player controls a spaceship, shoots enemies, and dodges incoming fire.
Multiple Levels: The game includes multiple waves of enemies, each becoming progressively more difficult.
Sound Effects: Enjoy various sound effects when shooting or defeating enemies for a more immersive experience.
