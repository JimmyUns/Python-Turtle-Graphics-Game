# Chicken Invader - Python Game

## Overview
This project is a **Chicken Invader-style** game created using **Turtle Graphics** in Python. Developed as part of a university elective course, this game brings a nostalgic arcade experience with a modern touch. The goal of the game is to defeat waves of chickens descending from above, using your spaceship to shoot at them and avoid their attacks.

## Features
- **Turtle Graphics**: The game utilizes the Turtle module for graphics, providing a simple yet effective way to render the game environment and characters.
- **Classic Gameplay**: The core mechanics are inspired by the iconic **Chicken Invaders** game, where the player controls a spaceship, shoots enemies, and dodges incoming fire.
- **Multiple Levels**: The game includes multiple waves of enemies, each becoming progressively more difficult.

   - Download the project files.
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
